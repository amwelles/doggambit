Training your dog for sports is a great way to bond with them and utilize their natural instincts. This is especially important for intelligent high-energy dogs bred to be hunting companions or work stock.

## Local recommendations

* [Teamworks](https://www.teamworksdogtraining.org/) (Youngsville) &mdash; my personal favorite! largest variety of sports/activities (more competition-oriented, although plenty of people take classes for fun)
* [Carolina Ranch](https://www.carolinaranchpets.com/) (Garner) &mdash; basic obedience, rally, and agility for fun
* [All Dogs Allowed](https://alldogsnc.com/) (Cary) &mdash; basic obedience and agility for fun

For all three, I'd suggest starting out by taking a [Canine Good Citizen](https://www.akc.org/products-services/training-programs/canine-good-citizen/) (basic obedience) class. You'll learn how to work with your dog and the basics of clicker training.

## Sports I've sampled

* [Trick Dog](https://www.akc.org/sports/trick-dog/) &mdash; just what it sounds like: tricks! beginner friendly, can be done virtually (send video to evaluator). after CGC, you only need five tricks to get a novice trick title.
* [Fetch](https://www.akc.org/fetch/) &mdash; exactly what it sounds like.
* [Rally Obedience](https://www.akc.org/sports/rally/) &mdash; heelwork and tricks on a preset course, beginner friendly, offers virtual titles (send video to be scored).
* [Scent Work](https://www.akc.org/sports/akc-scent-work/) &mdash; sniff out essential oils!
* [Barn Hunt](https://www.akc.org/sports/title-recognition-program/barn-hunt/) &mdash; find live rats (hidden in tubes; no rats are harmed).
* [Fast CAT](https://www.akc.org/sports/coursing/fast-cat/) &mdash; absolute easiest sport to get into: chase after a plastic bag on a string for 100 yards; courses are fenced-in, one dog at a time.
* [Treibball](https://www.nationaltreibball.com) &mdash; push exercise balls back to the handler in order.
* [Agility](https://www.akc.org/sports/agility/) &mdash; this one is the "flashiest" (and most fun for me, haha), but it also takes the most commitment/time to train and learn.

## Online option

If you don't mind some self-guided study, [Fenzi Dog Sports Academy](https://www.fenzidogsportsacademy.com/) offers a lot of awesome classes online. They're usually $65 to audit a 6-week course, more if you want instructor feedback.
