## Microchip

A microchip can never be separated from your dog, and it serves as a unique identifier for the duration of the dog's life. I also recommend this for cats! Microchips are inexpensive and a great way to make sure your pet will never truly be lost. [Free Pet Chip Registry](https://www.freepetchipregistry.com) is a great way to keep track of your pets' microchip numbers and your associated information.

## Identification Tags

Even for dogs who are microchipped, a collar or harness with tags will make sure you are contacted right away on the off-chance they get away from home. Tags should have, at minimum, a phone number. Be sure to check the tags regularly for signs of wearing. My personal favorite are tags that are metal plates attached to the collar or flat metal "washer" type tags that wear evenly on all sides.

## Leash

Even if your dog does not regularly go "out on the town" for walks, a leash may be needed for emergency transport. A six-foot leash is usually fine, but I often bring a long-line (used with a back-clip harness) if there is no fenced-in yard for the dogs to get some extra sniffing time in.

## Treats

My favorite treats for dogs are string cheese. It's easy to break into tiny pieces, few dogs are allergic to it, it's inexpensive, and—most importantly—dogs love it! Treats are great for practicing good behaviors, recalling a dog who needs to come back inside, or in the rare event a dog jumps a fence or bolts out the door.
