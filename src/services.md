# Services

## Pet Sitting

I stay in your home overnight. I'm happy to take care of small house chores—such as taking out the trash and bringing in the mail—while you are away.

## Drop-in or Walk

I'll stop in, check on your pets, walk them, let them out, feed them a meal, or whatever else you'd like for 30 minutes.
