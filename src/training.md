# Dog training

## Offerings

I offer a few different types of lessons. If any of these interest you, please [book a session](https://app.scritches.io/book/doggambit)!

### Canine Good Citizen Prep

> The AKC [Canine Good Citizen](https://www.akc.org/products-services/training-programs/canine-good-citizen/)™ (CGC) program provides a perfect framework for training your dog to become a polite member of society.

I'll help you and your dog pass the CGC test using positive reinforcement (treats and toys) and gradually fading out reinforcers for the test.

### Muzzle Acclimation

Muzzling your dog can be useful for a variety of reasons, and I love teaching all of my dogs to wear a muzzle. Whether a vet visit, grooming, emergency situations, or preventing scavenging muzzles are great for keeping everyone safe.

### Rally Foundations

Build off your CGC skills and learn the fun game of Rally Obedience! Teach your dog to navigate through a heeling course with twists and turns.

### Agility Foundations

Learn basic skills needed to start your agility journey, such as different crosses, forward drive, wraps, 2-on-2-off contacts, and 2x2 weaves.
