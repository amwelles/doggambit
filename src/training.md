# Dog training

> The AKC [Canine Good Citizen](https://www.akc.org/products-services/training-programs/canine-good-citizen/)â„¢ (CGC) program provides a perfect framework for training your dog to become a polite member of society.

I offer private lessons geared toward helping you and your dog pass the CGC test using positive reinforcement (treats and toys) and gradually fading out reinforcers for the test. These are "pay what you want" lessons. I want all dogs and their owners to be happy and well-behaved!
